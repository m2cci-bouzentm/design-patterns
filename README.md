## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Study and understand the fundamental design patterns presented in the Gang of Four book
- Practice implementing and applying these patterns
- Build a reference for future software design work

This is a learning-focused repository meant for personal growth and mastery of design pattern concepts.
